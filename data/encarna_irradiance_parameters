#	Aerosol scattering phase function
#	*********************************
#
# two-term Henyey Greenstein parameters - a g1 g2
# for areosol phase function
# a is a weighting parameter, g1, g2 are asymmetry parameters
# although these parameters are assumed constant with wavelength,
# they may not be....
# [Kattawar, 1975] gives the following parameters calculated at 550nm
# which may be used as defaults. 
# 	a  - might typically vary between 0.8 and 0.975 
#	g1 - might typically vary between 0.71 and 0.79
#	g2 - might typically vary between -0.764 and -0.286
#
#	(depending on the aerosol size distribution and refractive index)
#
# without fitting the function to various distributions,
# there is no real way of knowing sensible values to use....

#
#	Aerosol optical depth parameters
#	********************************
#
# parameters of aerosol optical depth formulae - alpha beta omega_A [H_Penndorf]
#
# omega_A is the aerosol single scattering albedo (assumed to be
# invariant with wavelength), which relates to the partitioning of
# aerosol optical depth between scattering and absorption.
# typical values are:
# 	0.6 - urban/industrial
#	0.9 - continental
# 	1.0 - maritime (pure scattering)
# the default value given here is therefore for continental aerosols
# 
# The parameters alpha and beta are used to give the aerosol
# optical depth [Angstrom, 1961] according to the empirical formula:
#
#	tau_A = beta * lambda^(-alpha)
#
# alpha is known as the wavelength exponent, and beta is a
# turbidity coefficient.
#
# alpha is generally in the range 1.3 +/- 0.2
# being seldom below 0.5 (polluted atmosphere e.g. forest fire, volcano)
# or above 1.6.
#
# [Angstrom, 1961] gives a formula for annual _mean_ values of beta 
# as a function of latitude (phi) and altitude (h in km above sea level):
#
#	beta = (0.025 + 0.100*cos^2(phi))*exp(-0.7*h)
#
# There is considerable seasonal variation in beta, with a maximum in
# mid-summer & a minimum in mid-winter. For Washington (State?), beta varies
# between around 0.05 in winter to 0.16 in summer. For Stockholm, it
# varies between about 0.03 in winter to 0.113 in summer.
#
# [Leckner, 1978] gives a table of high/medium/low values for 
# various latitudes:
#
#	lat:	  |	60N	45N	30N	0
#	----------------------------------------------
#	low lim:  |	0.01	0.047	0.047	0.047
#	med lim:  |	0.057	0.077	0.097	0.117
#	high lim: |	0.093	0.187	0.375	0.375
#
# so a value of 0.1 is the mean annual value for about 30N or 30S
# or mid-March or mid-September in Aachen
# or beginning of April or beginning of July in Stockholm
# or mid-Feb or beginning of August in Washington
#
#	H_Penndorf - haven't got much information on this...
#		~4 (km) for Antarctica [Shaw, 1982]
#		a value of 0.97 is suggested for over the sea
#		[Guzzi et al., 1987]. It relates to the vertical
#		distribution of aerosols (assumed to decay
#		according to exp(-h/H_Penndorf) (h,H_Penndorf in km)
#		It is an optional parameter & is only used if
#		-altitude and/or -ground flags are set in 'sky'
# as an alternative to this, the aerosol density function can be given 
# as a function of height

#	Water vapour optical depth
#	**************************
#
# water vapour optical depth parameters - CW [Td [KW]]
# where CW is the total precipitable water vapour in a vertical column (cm)
# and KW is a file containing spectral absorption coefficients of
# water vapour (cm^-1).
#
# KW data are from [Leckner, 1978] (you shouldn't need to change these)
# Typical values of CW are tabulated by [Leckner, 1978]:
#
#			CW
#	---------------------
#	15N	      |	4.1
#	45N (summer)  | 2.9
#	45N (winter)  | 0.9
#	60N (summer)  | 2.1
#	60N (winter)  | 0.4
#	US62	      | 1.4
#
# alternatively, the following relationships can be used:
#
# 	CW = 227.673 density_water(0)  	(standard atmosphere)
#
# where the density of water vapour (density_water(0)) can be obtained
# from tables or calculated from:
#	
#	density_water(0) = phi * Ps / (R * T(0))
#
# where 
#	phi  is the relative humidity (fractions of 1)
#	Ps   is the water vapour saturation pressure
#	T(0) is the absolute temperature (K)
#	R    is the gas constant ( = 461.51)
#
# Ps can be obtained from tables or calculated from:
#
#	Ps = exp(-5416/T(0) + 26.23)
#
# The default value of CW is 1.4 (i.e. the US62 value)
#
# Td is the dew point temperature, which is "the temperature at
# which the sturated vapour pressure of the water vapour is equal
# to the partial pressure of the water vapour in the atmosphere"
# [Nelkon & Parker, 1974]. Td is in degrees Celsius. A value of
# Td = 10.02 gives beta_0 = 0.639 [Guzzi et al., 1987]
#
# this is used in the following expression to calculate the scale
# height parameter of water vapour (beta_0) [Tomasi, 1977]:
# 
#	beta_0 = exp(-(lnCw - 0.061Td + 0.715)/0.983)
#
# the scale height Hw, being given by [Reitan, 1963]:
#
#	Hw(h0) = 1 - exp(-beta_0 * h0)
#
# specification of Td and the KW filename are optional.
